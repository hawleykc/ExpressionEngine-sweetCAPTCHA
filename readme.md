ExpressionEngine-sweetCAPTCHA
================================

Replaces the built-in CAPTCHA on member registration and comment forms with sweet CAPTCHA.

Just go to http://www.sweetcaptcha.com/register.php, replace sweetcaptchalib/sweetcaptcha.php with the downloaded file,
and place this directory under expressionengine/third-party.

You also need to make sure you replace the SWEETCAPTCHA_PUBLIC_URL value with the actual path to the
downloaded sweetcaptcha.php, usually expressionengine/third_party/sweetcaptcha/sweetcaptchalib/sweetcaptcha.php.
